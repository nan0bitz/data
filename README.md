# F4U

Documentation and subtitles regarding 'F4U' or 'Facility For You'; originally the concept was thought of actual working in an office environment because I saw it visually working there however, after discussing this with other business associates; it was mentioned that this could be used as:
//an app
//solution for individuals who lose their jobs on a mass scale
//provides key directional guidance for those no longer in prison
//enables at-risk-youth with value/tangibility for huge career potential

The name does not reflect the purpose of the system or program; so the concept will be renamed properly; understanding the execution and functionality of this system maybe the name could be "business analytical engine" (bae) for individuals; maps "unique characteristics" (uc); the entire process must be thoroughly checked prior to deciding the actual name

Developed concept by Brian Ettienne (NDC) Initial start **July 2012**
